# What Is This?
This is a place where I collate resources on learning to program that I would otherwise have to pick out of my brain at the request of my friends. It's probably closest in structure to an [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) repo.

## Practice
### [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
I *highly* recommend practising through Exercism - it's free, open source, and its code problems are extremely well thought-out and maintained. It has learning tracks for a lot of languages, too - including [the one this blog is written in](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure/)!

### [The Kattis Problem Archive](https://open.kattis.com/)
I'm not intimate with this one, but it has a great deal of pretty obscure languages in its list - ever wanted to solve fizzbuzz in [SNOBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOBOL)?
