# About Me

Hi! I'm Avery, an undergraduate in computer science and game development based in Victoria, Australia. I fell into computer science and programming in my primary school years, moving from ICT labs in [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) to my first taste of programming literature in a copy of the first edition of [Python For Kids](https://nostarch.com/python-kids-2nd-edition) gifted to me on my birthday.

<sup>1</sup> This blog was, in fact, written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) using the lovely [Powerpack](https://github.com/cjohansen/powerpack) toolkit.

You'll most often find me writing Rust and Clojure<sup>1</sup>, but I love to branch out to new languages! I've written programs in Common Lisp, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, Lua, and more -- the exhaustive list would be, er, exhaustive. With these languages I make games, websites, and input devices; analyse keyboard layouts; and generally solve problems.
