# About Me

Hi! I'm Avery, an undergraduate computer science and game development student based in Victoria, Australia. I fell into computer science and programming in my primary school years, moving from ICT labs in [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) to my first taste of programming literature in a copy of the first edition of [Python For Kids](https://nostarch.com/python-kids-2nd-edition) gifted to me on my birthday.

My interests in computer science include security, input methods, games development, and programming language theory. Outside of these, I write, design games, and think a lot about keyboards. I do most of my programming in Emacs on Linux. My favourite languages include Rust, Common Lisp, and Clojure.

### Aside: This Blog
This blog was written in the lovely [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) language using the [Powerpack](https://github.com/cjohansen/powerpack) toolkit. The colour scheme is based on [ef-arbutus](https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/blob/main/ef-arbutus-theme.el). There is currently no dark mode - in the interim, i recommend using [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/)
