# About Me

Hi! I'm Avery, a computer science student located in Australia.

I find myself deeply engaged in the study of programming languages, type systems, and how we can move towards a more memory safe future - these lead me to write a lot of Common Lisp and Rust. Outside of software, I'm passionate about linguistics, games development and writing, and accessibility in software and hardware; particularly when it comes to input methods.


### Aside: This Blog
This blog was written in the lovely [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) language using the [Powerpack](https://github.com/cjohansen/powerpack) toolkit.
