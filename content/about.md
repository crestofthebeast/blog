# About Me

Hi! I'm Avery, an undergraduate Computer Science student in Victoria, Australia. I fell into computer science and programming in my primary school years, moving from ICT labs in [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) to my first taste of programming literature in a copy of the first edition of [Python For Kids](https://nostarch.com/python-kids-2nd-edition) my dad got me for a birthday, which was widely regarded as a bad move in hindsight.

In the realm of computing in general, I find myself most interested in games development (the reason I learned to program in the first place), security (a frequent thread I find myself following), and human input. In computer science particularly, I am interested in secure programs and how we define "correctness" in the context of them. As a result of these intersections, I write a lot of Rust and Lisps - particularly Clojure and Common Lisp. Outside the realm of computer science, you'll find me talking a lot about keyboards, literature, video games, and accesibility.

### Aside: This Blog
This blog was written in the lovely [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) language using the [Powerpack](https://github.com/cjohansen/powerpack) toolkit.
