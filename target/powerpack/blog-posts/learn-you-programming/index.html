<p>This is a place where I collate resources on learning to program that I would otherwise have to pick out of my brain at the request of my friends. It’s probably closest in structure to an <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">awesome</a> repo.</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<h3><a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a></h3>
<p>I <em>highly</em> recommend practicing through exercism - it’s free, open source, and its code problems are extremely well thought-out and maintained. It has learning tracks for a lot of languages, too - including <a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure/">the one this blog is written in!</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://open.kattis.com/">The Kattis Problem Archive</a></h3>
<p>I’m not intimate with this one, but it has a great deal of pretty obscure languages in its list - ever wanted to solve fizzbuzz in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOBOL">SNOBOL</a>?</p>
